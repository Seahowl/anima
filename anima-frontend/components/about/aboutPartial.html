    <p>Hello!  If you're taking the time to read this, you probably want to know more about me.  Good!  First off, though, take a gander at that sexy specimen of masculinity smiling at you.  That's me!  Brandon Slick is my name, slayer of bugs and consumer of caffiene.  I'm a developer by trade, with a background in modernizing old corporate applications to something a little newer and fresher.  I'll go over my background in a little more detail here, but if you want a business-ready resume, send me an email using the link in the footer and I'll be happy to send you one.  Outside of work, I'm a pretty decent cook, a middling brewer, and a dabbler in various types of crafts.  My real love, however, is gaming in pretty much all stripes and forms.  I'm an avid PC gamer with a preference for some of the older styles of games, as well as a handheld afficianado.  I also collect tabletop RPG books from several different systems, though since I don't get out much it's mostly for the pretty pictures.</p>   
    <p>Nothing particularily interesting happened to me before I turned eighteen, so things really started when I got to college.  My alma mater is the University of Wisconsin - Superior, from which I obtained a Bachelor's degree in computer science.  It's a little nontraditional there, since we were allowed to just have computer science as our major without a minor if we took the comprehensive course of study.  The difference between that and the non-comprehensive was an additional set of courses starting with software development and progressing to networking, operating system design, and harware architecture.  I also picked up some unrelated people-management skills when I headed one of the campus student organizations, though bureaucracy took up a good chunk of the time I spent on that.</p>  
    <p>I graduated in 2013, and things were quiet for a few months as I got my bearings.  There was some post-graduation relaxation in there, but I also spent a few months helping out with reconstruction from a flood we had in the area the year before.  It was roughly at that point that I got a call from a company called EDCi. They did technology consulting and had an opportunity for me in the Sheboygan area working with Bemis Manufacturing.  Not being particularly choosy at that point in time, I agreed and ended up moving out here to work with them.</p> 
    <p>Contracting at Bemis was an interesting position for my first job out of school.  The senior programmers there were working on taking systems developed decades ago for the AS/400 and transitioning them to a modern GUI application framework, so myself and the other contractor joined the two support developers they had in handline any issues or feature enhancements requested for the AS/400 programs.  That was the first time I had to deal with users, and while it was trying at times I learned a lot about how to approach those of a non-technical background from a position of mutual understanding.</p> 
    <p>My contract with EDCi and Bemis ended after a few months there, leaving me searching in the Sheboygan area for a new position, as EDCi didn't have any other clients looking to hire.  I didn't do my due dilligence when I moved over here, which meant that I found out that it was a very soft area for technology at the worst possible time.  I spent a couple of months looking for another position, and found myself working for Piggly Wiggly Midwest, a regional grocery chain.  I've been there since, and I have to say that I've enjoyed it so far.</p>   
    <p>Most of what I've been doing is taking old VB6 code and programs and rewriting them, either as a VB.net console application or an ASP.net website for our intranet.  I haven't had to do much direct user support as I'm working in an old, stable codebase, but deciphering the intent behind some of the older things I've worked with has been a challenge.  It has also been a much broader experience than my work at Bemis, as I've worked with reporting through Crystal Reports, XML and CSV document shuffling, Microsoft Word automation, and even the Dynamics AX2102 accounting software.</p>  
    <p>My proudest achievement so far has been taking our old central billing software from VB6 and, over the course of a few months, creating a new and extensible web interface.  It was a pretty heavily used production system, so the users were hesitant at first to work with me on the new system, but eventually the advantages won them over.  I'm a little more proud of how seamlessly the change went off, though.  No major bugs, very few minor bugs, and a user interface that was easy and intuitive.</p>
